👋 Hi, I’m Chakradhar Rangi
Physics PhD Candidate @ Louisiana State University | Aspiring Quantitative Researcher & Data Scientist

I specialize in bridging the gap between theoretical physics and real-world data by developing high-performance numerical algorithms to model complex systems.

🔭 Current Focus: Completing my PhD research on developing numerical algorithms for disordered correlated quantum systems and transitioning to industry roles.

💼 Looking for: Full-time Quantitative Research, Quantitative Analysis, or Data Science positions starting Summer/Fall 2026.

🛠️ Tech Stack: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas), and PyTorch/scikit-learn.

💞️ Collaboration: I’m open to collaborating on computational modeling, stochastic processes, or open-source scientific computing projects.
